## Analysis
1. Network activity continues to improve:
   - New record low inactive neurons (6.5%)
   - Better spike timing characteristics
   - Increased mean spike count

2. Activity distribution improvements:
   - Balanced increase in both low and medium activity
   - Maintained absence of overactive neurons
   - More uniform neuron participation

3. Network stability indicators:
   - Stable weight distribution
   - Consistent theta adaptation
   - No signs of destabilization

## Conclusions
1. Optimization continues to yield positive results
2. Network shows improved efficiency without compromising stability
3. Still no signs of approaching optimization limit

## Recommendations
1. Continue optimization with theta_plus_e = 0.15mV
2. Monitor for:
   - Further reduction in inactive neurons
   - Maintenance of healthy activity distribution
   - Any early warning signs of network instability
