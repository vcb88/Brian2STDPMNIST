## Analysis
1. Network activity shows mixed trends:
   - Record low inactive neurons (5.8%)
   - Decreased overall activity level
   - More compact activity timeframe

2. Activity distribution shifts:
   - Significant increase in low-activity neurons
   - Decrease in medium-activity neurons
   - Maintained absence of overactive neurons

3. Network stability indicators:
   - Stable weight distribution
   - Consistent theta adaptation
   - Reduced activity intensity

## Conclusions
1. Continued improvement in neuron participation
2. Possible signs of approaching optimization limit:
   - Smaller improvement increment (0.7% vs previous 1.5%)
   - Shift towards lower activity levels
   - Reduced mean spike count

## Recommendations
1. Conduct final verification with theta_plus_e = 0.16mV
2. Monitor for:
   - Confirmation of optimization limit
   - Potential performance degradation
   - Further shifts in activity distribution
