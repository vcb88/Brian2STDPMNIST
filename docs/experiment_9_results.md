## Analysis
1. Significant improvement in network activity:
   - Record low inactive neurons (8.0%)
   - Decrease of 3.2% from previous experiment
   - No signs of optimization limit reached

2. Activity distribution changes:
   - Slight increase in low-activity neurons
   - Decrease in medium-activity neurons
   - Maintained absence of overactive neurons

3. Network stability indicators:
   - Healthy weight distribution
   - No weight saturation issues
   - Consistent theta adaptation

## Conclusions
1. Unexpected positive results challenge the optimization limit hypothesis
2. Network maintains stable and balanced activity
3. No negative side effects from parameter increase observed

## Recommendations
1. Continue optimization with theta_plus_e = 0.14mV
2. Monitor for:
   - Further reduction in inactive neurons
   - Changes in activity distribution
   - Potential early signs of network instability
