# Network Improvement Hypotheses

This document tracks potential improvements based on diagnostic analysis of the network's behavior.

## Current Observations (as of February 2025)

### Silent Neurons Issue (35.5% inactive)

Current diagnostic data shows:
- Input weights (XeAe) appear normal
- Output weights (AeAi) show anomalies:
  * Zero weights present
  * High variance (Std: 0.519350)
  * Very low mean (0.026000)
- Thresholds (theta):
  * Silent neurons: fixed at 0.019786
  * Active neurons: range 0.019836 - 0.023811

### Temporal Dynamics
- First spike: 84.1 ms
- Last spike: 107332.0 ms
- Large variation in activation timing
- Uneven activity distribution across time

## Improvement Hypotheses

### 1. Threshold Adaptation Mechanism (Priority: High)
**Status: In Progress**
- Add initialization noise to thresholds
- Review and adjust adaptation parameters
- Consider dynamic adaptation rates

### 2. Output Weight Initialization (Priority: Medium)
**Status: Proposed**
- Prevent zero weights in initialization
- Implement more uniform initial distribution
- Consider minimum weight constraints

### 3. Homeostatic Mechanisms (Priority: Medium)
**Status: Proposed**
- Add activity normalization
- Implement target activity levels
- Consider local inhibition adjustments

### 4. Temporal Distribution (Priority: Low)
**Status: Proposed**
- Analyze input pattern timing
- Consider temporal regularization
- Investigate activation delays

## Implementation Notes

### Current Focus
Currently implementing threshold adaptation improvements:
1. Adding controlled noise to initial thresholds
2. Adjusting adaptation parameters
3. Monitoring effects on neuron activation rates

### Future Steps
1. Monitor effects of threshold changes
2. Collect data on activation patterns
3. Evaluate need for additional mechanisms

## Success Metrics
- Reduce silent neuron percentage below 20%
- Achieve more uniform threshold distribution
- Maintain or improve classification accuracy
- Reduce temporal activation variance
