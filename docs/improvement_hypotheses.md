## Improvement Hypotheses

### 1. Threshold Adaptation Mechanism (Priority: High)
**Status: In Progress**
- Add initialization noise to thresholds
- Review and adjust adaptation parameters
- Consider dynamic adaptation rates
- Add homeostatic threshold regulation

### 2. Output Weight Initialization (Priority: High)
**Status: Pending**
- Current issues:
  * Zero weights present
  * Extremely high variance (std/mean > 20)
  * Very low mean value
- Proposed solutions:
  * Establish minimum weight threshold
  * Reduce initial weight variance
  * Increase mean weight value
  * Implement weight normalization

### 3. Temporal Dynamics Optimization (Priority: High)
**Status: Pending**
- Current issues:
  * Large activation time spread
  * Possible wave-like activation patterns
  * Potential synchronization problems
- Proposed solutions:
  * Add inhibitory neuron synchronization
  * Modify synaptic delays
  * Implement group refractory periods
  * Add temporal regularization

### 4. Activity Distribution Improvements (Priority: Medium)
**Status: Pending**
- Current issues:
  * High neuron competition
  * Insufficient specialization
  * Excitation/inhibition imbalance
- Proposed solutions:
  * Implement lateral inhibition
  * Modify STDP for better specialization
  * Add synaptic weight normalization
  * Balance excitation/inhibition

### 5. Input Weight Optimization (Priority: Medium)
**Status: Pending**
- Current issues:
  * Narrow weight range
  * Insufficient input selectivity
  * Poor rare pattern learning
- Proposed solutions:
  * Expand weight range
  * Modify STDP rules
  * Implement input normalization
  * Add pattern-specific adaptations

### 6. Metabolic Optimization (Priority: Low)
**Status: Pending**
- Current issues:
  * High percentage of silent neurons
  * Low mean activity
  * Possible energy optimization
- Proposed solutions:
  * Add metabolic cost for inactivity
  * Implement activity rewards
  * Modify inhibition/excitation balance
  * Add homeostatic activity regulation

### 7. Network Structure Optimization (Priority: Low)
**Status: Pending**
- Current issues:
  * Possible topology problems
  * Connection density issues
  * Non-optimal connection distribution
- Proposed solutions:
  * Modify connection topology
  * Add local connectivity
  * Experiment with connection sparsity
  * Implement structured connectivity

## Implementation Strategy

### Current Focus
Testing threshold homeostasis mechanism:
1. Return to original theta adaptation
2. Add homeostatic threshold adjustment
3. Initialize theta below homeostatic threshold
4. Reduce initial theta variance

### Planned Sequence
1. Complete threshold homeostasis testing
2. Address output weight initialization
3. Optimize temporal dynamics
4. Implement lateral inhibition
5. Review and adjust based on results

## Success Metrics
- Primary:
  * Reduce silent neuron percentage below 20%
  * Achieve more uniform activity distribution
  * Maintain or improve classification accuracy
- Secondary:
  * Reduce temporal activation variance
  * Improve weight distribution
  * Optimize energy efficiency
